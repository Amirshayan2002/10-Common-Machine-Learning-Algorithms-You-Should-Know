**10 Common Machine Learning Algorithms You Should Know**


Linear Regression: A statistical method that is used to establish the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable(s) .

Logistic Regression: A statistical method used to analyze a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. It is used to predict a binary outcome (1 / 0, Yes / No, True / False) given a set of independent variables .

Decision Tree: A decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements 1.

SVM Algorithm: A supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. It is used to find the best boundary between the two classes in a dataset .

Naive Bayes Algorithm: A probabilistic algorithm that is used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' theorem and the assumption of independence between predictors .

KNN Algorithm: A non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is used to find the k-nearest neighbors of a data point in a dataset .

K-means: A clustering algorithm that is used to partition a set of data points into k clusters. It is used to group similar data points together .

Forest Algorithm: A machine learning algorithm that is used for classification, regression, and clustering tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of the model.

Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms: A set of techniques used to reduce the number of features in a dataset. It is used to simplify the dataset and improve the performance of the model .

Gradient Boosting Algorithm and AdaBoosting Algorithm: Two algorithms used for boosting in machine learning. They are used to improve the accuracy of the model by combining multiple weak models .
